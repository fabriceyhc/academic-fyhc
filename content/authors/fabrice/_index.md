I am a second year computer science PhD student at [UCLA](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) 
where I am advised by [Miryung Kim](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/) and am a member 
of both the [Software Evolution and Analysis Lab](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/research.html) 
and the [Statistical Machine Learning Lab](https://www.uclaml.org/).

My research aims at understanding the intricacies of training and testing ML systems. 
At the moment, I am working on unifying and expanding data augmentation and metamorphic 
testing techniques into a broader framework of invariant, sibylvariant &trade;, and mixed transformations.
