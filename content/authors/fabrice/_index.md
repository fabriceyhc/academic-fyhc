I am a computer science PhD student at UCLA where I am part of the [Software Evolution and Analysis Lab](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/research.html) 
and advised by [Miryung Kim](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/). I also work with [Violet Peng](https://vnpeng.net/) in the 
[PLUS Lab](https://vnpeng.net/members/) and [Quanquan Gu](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~qgu/) in the [Statistical Machine Learning Lab](https://www.uclaml.org/people.html). 

My research aims at developing new techniques for training, testing, and evaluating ML systems. 
Previously, this has entailed devising novel adversarial attacks, investigating test metrics like neuron coverage 
for deep learning models, and proposing sibylvariant transformations to improve model generalization and robustness. 
My current projects span two distinct areas: a) building fine-grained data lineage to support the creation 
of automated data augmentation policies and data exploration; b) developing reference-free evaluation metrics 
to measure the diversity and engagingness of natural language generation systems.
