I recently completed my PhD in Computer Science at [UCLA](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) (May 2025). My doctoral research focused on pioneering holistic and robust evaluation frameworks for AI systems, aiming to enhance their reliability, utility, trustworthiness, and human-centric qualities.

I was primarily advised by Prof. [Miryung Kim](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~miryung/). Throughout my PhD, I had the privilege of collaborating closely with Prof. [Nanyun (Violet) Peng](https://vnpeng.net/) (PLUS Lab), Prof. [Quanquan Gu](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~qgu/) (Statistical Machine Learning Lab), and Prof. [Amit Sahai](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sahai/).

My research spanned several key areas, contributing to:

* **Advanced AI Testing & Robustness:** Critically analyzing existing AI testing metrics (like neuron coverage), exploring fuzzing techniques, investigating adversarial attack methodologies, and developing novel approaches for AI content watermarking to ensure provenance.
* **Data-Centric AI Innovation:** Designing and implementing novel data augmentation strategies (e.g., sibylvariant transformations, feature-aware methods) to improve model generalization, along with frameworks for provenance tracking in synthetic data.
* **Human-Centric Quality Assessment:** Leading award-winning research to define and measure nuanced, human-perceived qualities in language model outputs, such as engagement, psychological depth, and linguistic diversity, often validated through extensive human studies.
* **Applied AI & Societal Considerations:** Developing specialized AI models for practical challenges (e.g., substance use detection in medical texts) and exploring methods for enhancing cultural inclusion and fairness in AI systems.

Building on this foundation, I am now channeling my expertise into founding **[Kairno](https://kairno.com)**, a new venture dedicated to automating and elevating the research review process using advanced AI. Our goal is to make deep, actionable critique accessible to everyone engaged in scientific work.
